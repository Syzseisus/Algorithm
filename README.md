    <p>https://leetcode.com/problems/maximal-square/</br>
  Given an <code>m x n</code> binary <code>matrix</code> filled with <code>0</code>'s and <code>1</code>'s, <i>find the largest square containing only <code>1</code>'s and return its area.</i></br></p>
  </br>

Example 1:

Example 3:

```
Input: matrix = [["0"]]
Output: 0
```

**Constraints**:
* `m == matrix.length`
* `n == matrix[i].length`
* `1 <= m, n <= 300`
* `matrix[i][j] is '0' or '1'.`
